<h2><i>Elements of Finite Geometry</i>, by Steven H. Cullinane</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Last updated on Jan. 9, 2016 (replaced the compressed folder).</p>
<p>This material is intended as a course supplement or independent-study source for college students (undergraduate and graduate) who have taken courses in abstract algebra (linear algebra and group theory) and modern geometry (affine, projective, finite).</p>
<p>It may also interest some professional mathematicians, since the content has not been published previously except as follows.</p>
<p>A preliminary version was distributed at the 1976 summer AMS-MAA joint summer meetings in Toronto. Excerpts were published in the journal <em>Computer Graphics and Art</em> (Vol. 2, No. 1, February 1977, pp. 5-7).</p>
<p>Additional notes were distributed informally, and are available as <em>Notes on Groups and Geometry, 1978-1986</em> (pdf ). These and later notes are, at this writing, on the Web at http://finitegeometry.org/sc/map.html. This book is based on the notes at that site.</p>

<p>A compressed folder of about 35 MB containing all the material at that site may be downloaded.  Click <a href="./finitegeometry-Jan-9-2016.zip">here</a>.</p>
