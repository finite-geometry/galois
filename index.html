<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Last updated on Jan. 9, 2016 (replaced the compressed folder)
and on Jan. 23, 2016 (added Dropbox link).</p>

<p>This material is intended as a course supplement or
independent-study source for college students (undergraduate and
graduate) who have taken courses in abstract algebra (linear algebra
and group theory) and modern geometry (affine, projective, finite).</p>

<p>It may also interest some professional mathematicians, since
the content has not been published previously except as follows.</p>

<p>A preliminary version was distributed at the 1976 summer
AMS-MAA joint summer meetings in Toronto. Excerpts were published in
the journal <em>Computer Graphics and Art</em> (Vol. 2,
No. 1, February 1977, pp. 5-7).</p>

<p>Additional notes were distributed informally, and are
available as <em>Notes on Groups and Geometry, 1978-1986</em>
(pdf ). These and later notes are, at this writing, on the Web at
http://finitegeometry.org/sc/map.html. This book is based on the notes
at that site.</p> These notes are also available (as of Jan 23, 2016) 
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/hh88rykuq5vpma2/AADLmYEqv4vz7Pajm9jxo3lUa?dl=0)">at Dropbox.</a>

<p>A compressed folder of about 35 MB containing all the 
finitegeometry.org material may be downloaded.
