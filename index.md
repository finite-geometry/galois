# Introduction

This material is intended as a course supplement or independent-study source for college students (undergraduate and graduate) who have taken courses in abstract algebra (linear algebra and group theory) and modern geometry (affine, projective, finite).

It may also interest some professional mathematicians, since the content has not been published previously except as follows.

A preliminary version was distributed at the 1976 summer AMS-MAA joint summer meetings in Toronto. Excerpts were published in the journal _Computer Graphics and Art_ (Vol. 2, No. 1, February 1977, pp. 5-7).  

Additional notes were distributed informally, and are available as _Notes on Groups and Geometry, 1978-1986_ (pdf ). These and later notes are, at this writing, on the Web at p://finitegeometry.org/sc/map.html. This book is based on the notes at that site.
